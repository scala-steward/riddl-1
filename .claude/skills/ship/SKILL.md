# Ship Skill

Executes a full release cycle for the riddl project. Follow each
step in order. **STOP immediately** if any assertion fails and
report the problem.

## Arguments

The user should provide a version number (e.g., `1.10.1`). If
not provided:
1. Run `git tag --sort=-v:refname | head -5` to find the
   actual latest tag (not just reachable from current branch)
2. Run `git log --oneline <latest-tag>..HEAD` to see changes
3. Analyze per semver and **recommend** a version (don't ask
   the user to choose — present your recommendation and let
   them confirm or override)

## Pre-Flight Checks

1. Assert current branch is `main`:
   ```
   git branch --show-current
   ```
   If not on `main`, ask the user before switching. **Never
   publish from `development` or feature branches.**

2. Assert working tree is clean:
   ```
   git status --porcelain
   ```
   If dirty, list the uncommitted files and ask the user how
   to proceed.

3. **GITHUB_TOKEN handling**: Do NOT `unset GITHUB_TOKEN`
   globally — sbt needs it for GitHub Packages resolution.
   Only unset it immediately before `gh` commands:
   ```
   unset GITHUB_TOKEN && gh ...
   ```

4. When switching to `main`, always `git pull` first to
   ensure local main is up to date with origin.

5. Verify the version tag does not already exist:
   ```
   git tag -l <VERSION>
   ```

## Ship Steps

6. **Ensure the working tree is clean before tagging.**
   sbt-dynver derives the version from `git describe`;
   any dirty tree causes it to append a
   `<VERSION>-N-<hash>-<timestamp>` suffix instead of
   the clean `<VERSION>`. This suffix would propagate
   to BuildInfo, all published artifacts, and npm
   packages. Check:
   ```
   git status --porcelain
   ```
   If any files are modified or untracked, commit them
   now before proceeding.

7. Create an annotated git tag:
   ```
   git tag -a <VERSION> -m "Release <VERSION>"
   ```

8. Verify dynver resolves to the clean version:
   ```
   sbt 'show riddlc/version'
   ```
   The output must be exactly `<VERSION>` with no suffix.
   If it has a suffix, do NOT proceed — delete the tag
   (`git tag -d <VERSION>`), fix the issue, and re-tag.

9. Run the full test suite and publish all modules:
   ```
   sbt clean test publish
   ```
   Because the tag is on HEAD and the tree is clean,
   BuildInfo and all published artifacts will carry the
   clean `<VERSION>`. Verify in the sbt output.
   **If tests fail, delete the tag** (`git tag -d
   <VERSION>`) — do NOT push a broken release.

10. Push commits and tag to origin:
    ```
    git push origin main <VERSION>
    ```

11. Create a GitHub release:
    ```
    unset GITHUB_TOKEN && gh release create <VERSION> \
      --title "Release <VERSION>" --generate-notes
    ```
    This triggers the Release Artifacts workflow (native
    builds, Homebrew formula update) and the npm-publish
    workflow automatically.

## Post-Release Verification

12. Confirm the release exists:
    ```
    unset GITHUB_TOKEN && gh release view <VERSION>
    ```

13. Run `git status` to confirm the working tree is clean.

14. Switch back to `development` and merge the tag forward:
    ```
    git checkout development
    git merge main
    git push
    ```

15. Report a summary: tag, commit SHA, release URL, and any
    CI workflows triggered.

16. **Drop upgrade tasks in dependent projects.** For each
    consumer of riddl, create a task file in its `task/`
    directory describing the version bump needed. The file
    should be named `upgrade-riddl-<VERSION>.md` and contain:
    - What changed (link to the GitHub release)
    - The new version to depend on
    - Which files to update (e.g., `project/Dependencies.scala`,
      `build.sbt`, or `package.json`)

    Consumer projects:
    ```
    ../synapify/task/upgrade-riddl-<VERSION>.md
    ../riddl-idea-plugin/task/upgrade-riddl-<VERSION>.md
    ../riddlsim/task/upgrade-riddl-<VERSION>.md
    ../ossum.tech/task/upgrade-riddl-<VERSION>.md
    ../riddl-mcp-server/task/upgrade-riddl-<VERSION>.md
    ../riddl-models/task/upgrade-riddl-<VERSION>.md
    ../ossum.ai/task/upgrade-riddl-<VERSION>.md
    ../riddl-gen/task/upgrade-riddl-<VERSION>.md
    ```

    Also update the `riddl dep` column in
    `../CLAUDE.md` (ossuminc-level) to reflect `<VERSION>`.

## If Something Fails

- If tests fail in step 9: delete the local tag
  (`git tag -d <VERSION>`), fix, and restart from step 6.
  Do NOT push a broken tag.
- If dynver shows a suffix in step 8: delete the tag, fix
  the dirty tree, and re-tag.
- If tag push fails in step 10: check if tag exists
  remotely.
- If publish fails in step 9: check credentials and retry
  (tag is still local, safe to retry).
- If `gh release create` fails in step 11: the tag is
  already pushed, so the release can be created manually
  or retried.
- **Never force-push tags** without explicit user approval.
